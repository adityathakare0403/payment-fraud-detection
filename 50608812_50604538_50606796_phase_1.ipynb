        "Behavioural Patterns: Customers' behaviour also depends on the time of day. Overnight transactions, for example, have less oversight and more anonymity and therefore hold greater potential for fraudulent activities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Operational Factors: Most businesses will be having a skeleton crew during very late or very early hours. These periods will therefore mean that transactions are not monitored as carefully and there is less support to react quickly to suspicious activities.\n",

        "**Importance:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Identifying Behavioural Patterns: Analyzing the time of fraud transactions will relate to the behavioural patterns of fraudsters. Understanding when fraud is most likely to occur means there are familiar tactics against which organizations can adapt their defenses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Operational Improvement: Peak hours of fraud help the organization in optimizing its resources. For instance, if data reflected that most frauds happened after midnight, a company would increase monitoring and fraud detection at such hours to avoid any possible loss.\n",

        "**Hypothesis Rationale**\n",
        "\n",
        "Lack of Transaction History: New accounts lack transaction history, and no pattern can be established to indicate a trend in legitimate behavior. Fraudsters are normally taking advantage of the lack of history since there are no prior behaviors to which one could compare when assessing legitimacy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Vulnerability to Exploitation: In general, fraudsters may target new accounts since they are less monitored. And most probably, they would have been opened without strict identity verification processes in place. This makes newer accounts the favorite target for fraudsters.\n",

For instance, organizations can make promotional offers that incentivize customers to engage when they are on the site, but security measures will be in place.\n",
        "\n",
        "Supporting Regulatory Compliance:Many industries have certain regulations that call for them to put in place methods for fraud prevention. It would also be of significance to an organization in case there are risks related to new accounts to also note them to ensure compliance with the set regulations to avoid probable penalties."

        "Security Measures: The associations between the mode of payments and fraud assist firms in implementing extra security measures around the risky payment types.\n",
